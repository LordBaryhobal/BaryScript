# BaryScript

BaryScript is programming language I created greatly inspired by Python and JavaScript.

Some example scripts can be found in [examples](examples).

To execute a file, run the following command:
```
python interpreter2/main.py <path to the script>
```

## Requirements

Python 3 or higher
